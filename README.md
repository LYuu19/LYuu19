### Hi there, I'm Yujing Lu (陆雨婧 in Chinese)! 👋

🌱Short Bio: My name is Yujing Lu (陆雨婧 in Chinese). I am a master's student at the University of Warwick. Before joining Warwick, I earned my Bachelor's degree from the University of Nottingham (2022). See my homepage and CV for more information.

🔭Study Plan: I am looking forward to my master's study in Warwrcik and hope to find out my research interests in statistics in the following year of study. I am learning python recently and I will keep updating my projects on GitHub.

😄 I am broadly interested in biology statistics and bayesian statistics. And I am looking for opportunities for RA positions in the UK, U.S., and China.

🏃 I am also a beginner in auto belay climbing and squash.
